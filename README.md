# Word Difficuilty Predictor

Readability gives a prediction as to how hard readers will discover a unique word. The
Common Core State Standards outline phrase complexity as two intently related thing out of
which first one is qualitative dimensions of word complexity which refer to these aspects of
word complexity only measurable with the aid of an attentive human reader, such as depth of
meaning or purpose; structure; language conventionality readability and knowledge demands.
And the second is quantitative dimensions of phrase complexity: The terms quantitative
dimensions and quantitative elements refer to these factors of phrase complexity, such as size
of the word or frequency of occurrence of that word, sentence length, that are hard for a
human reader to evaluate correctly and therefore nowadays laptop software program are used
for the evaluation. This model makes use of phonetics and LSTM based deep mastering
method to discover the complexity or problem degree of word.
